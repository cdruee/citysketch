Canvas
=======

The canvas is the main working area where you create and edit buildings. It supports multiple interaction modes and provides visual feedback for all operations.

Coordinate Display
------------------

The canvas uses a coordinate system with:

* **Origin (0,0)**: Configurable based on your geographic location
* **Units**: Meters  
* **Axes**: X increases eastward, Y increases northward
* **Display**: World coordinates shown in status bar

Visual Elements
----------------

**Grid**
   Background grid helps with alignment. Grid spacing adjusts with zoom level.

**Buildings**
   * **Unselected**: Light gray fill with dark border
   * **Selected**: Blue fill with blue border
   * **Preview**: Semi-transparent green during creation

**Basemap** *(when enabled)*
   Map tiles provide geographic context. Tiles load automatically as you navigate.

**GeoTIFF Overlay** *(when loaded)*
   Custom imagery displayed between basemap and buildings with adjustable opacity.

Selection Handles
-----------------

Selected buildings show corner handles for editing:

* **Square Handles**: Normal scaling mode - drag to resize
* **Circular Handles**: Rotation mode (when Ctrl is held) - drag to rotate

Mouse Interaction
=================

The canvas responds to various mouse actions depending on the current mode:

Normal Mode (Default)
---------------------

**Single Click**
   * On empty space: Deselects all buildings
   * On building: Selects that building
   * With Ctrl: Adds/removes building from selection

**Click and Drag**  
   * On empty space: Pans the view
   * On building: Moves selected buildings
   * On corner handle: Resizes building (or rotates if Ctrl held)
   * With Shift: Starts rectangle selection

**Mouse Wheel**
   Zooms in/out centered on mouse cursor position

Add Building Mode
------------------

**First Click**
   Sets the first corner of the building (snapped if snap is enabled)

**Mouse Movement**
   Shows preview of building being created

**Second Click**
   Completes building creation and returns to normal mode

**Ctrl Key**
   During building creation, switches between scale and rotation modes

Add Round Building Mode
-----------------------

**First Click**
   Sets center point of circular building

**Mouse Movement**
   Shows circular preview with radius determined by distance from center

**Second Click**
   Completes circular building creation

Rectangle Selection Mode
------------------------

**Click and Drag**
   Creates selection rectangle. All buildings completely within rectangle are selected when mouse is released.

Status Bar
===========

The status bar displays important information:

Status Information
------------------

**Left Section**: Current operation status
