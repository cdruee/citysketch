Customizing Shortcuts
======================

Current Limitations
-------------------

CitySketch currently uses fixed keyboard shortcuts that cannot be customized. However, the shortcuts follow standard conventions:

* **Ctrl + Letter**: Standard application functions (Save, Open, etc.)
* **Function Keys**: Special features (F3 for 3D view)
* **Number Keys**: Quick actions (building heights)
* **Modifier Combinations**: Advanced operations

Future Customization
--------------------

Future versions may support:

* User-definable shortcuts
* Alternative key bindings
* Regional keyboard layout support
* Accessibility-focused key combinations

Shortcut Conflicts
===================

System Shortcuts
----------------

Some shortcuts may conflict with system or desktop environment shortcuts:

**Windows**:
- Ctrl + Q may not work on some systems
- Alt + Tab switches between applications
- Windows Key shortcuts take precedence

**macOS**:
- Cmd key replaces Ctrl in most shortcuts
- System shortcuts override application shortcuts
- Mission Control may intercept some combinations

**Linux**:
- Desktop environment shortcuts vary
- Window manager shortcuts take precedence
- Custom key bindings may conflict

Resolution Strategies
---------------------

If shortcuts don't work:

1. **Check Menu Items**: All shortcuts are also available through menus
2. **Use Toolbar**: Most functions have toolbar buttons
3. **Check System Settings**: Disable conflicting system shortcuts
4. **Use Alternative Methods**: Mouse operations work for all functions

Accessibility
==============

Alternative Input Methods
-------------------------

For users who cannot use standard shortcuts:

**Mouse Alternatives**:
- All functions available through menus
- Toolbar buttons for common operations
- Context menus *(planned feature)*

**Keyboard Alternatives**:
- Tab navigation through interface elements
- Arrow keys for menu navigation
- Enter/Space for button activation

**Visual Impairments**:
- High contrast mode available through color settings
- Zoom controls for better visibility
- Status bar provides text feedback

Memory Aids
============

Shortcut Categories
-------------------

**File Operations**: Start with Ctrl + (N/O/S/Q)
**View Operations**: Use Ctrl + number or symbols (+/-)  
**Building Heights**: Direct number keys (1-9)
**Special Features**: Function keys (F3)

Common Patterns
---------------

* **Ctrl + Letter**: Application-wide functions
* **Ctrl + Symbol**: View controls  
* **Shift + Action**: Modified behavior (selection, etc.)
* **Function Keys**: Special modes and features

Platform Differences
=====================

Windows
--------

All shortcuts work as documented. Ctrl key is the primary modifier.

macOS  
------

Replace Ctrl with Cmd (⌘) for most shortcuts:
- ⌘ + N (New)
- ⌘ + O (Open)  
- ⌘ + S (Save)
- ⌘ + Q (Quit)

Linux
------

Shortcuts work as documented on most distributions. Some window managers may intercept certain key combinations.

Next Steps
===========

After learning these shortcuts:

1. Practice with simple projects to build muscle memory
2. Start with the most common shortcuts (Ctrl+S, 1-9, Delete)
3. Gradually incorporate view controls (Ctrl+0, Ctrl+±)
4. Explore advanced features (F3 for 3D view)

.. tip::
   Don't try to memorize all shortcuts at once. Focus on the ones you use most frequently, then gradually add others to your workflow.
